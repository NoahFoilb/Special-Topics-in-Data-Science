# Question 1 
```{r}
#1 Plot letter B 
#2 Plot letter C
#3 Plot letter D
#4 Plot letter A
```


# Question 2
```{r}
# I believe that since the histogram bins the data together for graph we cannont see what is accuratly going on inbetween each x axis coordinate. The QQ plot is more descriptive because of this. 
```



# Question 3
```{r}
qqnorm(fdims$kne.di)
qqline(fdims$kne.di)
# This is going to be right skewed you can tell since the Q-Q plot is more so above the line newar the ends
```


# Confirm data
```{r}
hist(fdims$kne.di)
# findings were correct
```
