# Load Dataset in from source & libraries
```{r}
source("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/present.R") # The database
source("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/arbuthnot.R")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

#1 What years are included in this dataset? What are the dimensions of the data frame and what are the column names
```{r}
# Year ranges from 1940 - 2002
min(present$year)
max(present$year)

# Dimensions are 63 rows and 3 columns
dim(present)

# The column names are year, boys, girls
names(present)
```


#2 Compare the two datasets
```{r}
arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls
```
```{r}
present$boys + present$girls
```
```{r}
# I took each dataset and summed up the amount of total population each year recorded and the Present dataset has a much larger number of records. 
```


#3 Make a plot that displays the boy-to-girl ratio for every year in the data set. What do you see? Does Arbuthnotâ€™s observation about boys being born in greater proportion than girls hold up in the U.S.? Include the plot in your response.   
```{r}
GB <- present$boys/present$girls
ggplot(present, aes(x = year, y = GB))+ geom_point(colour="blue")

# As you can see the ratio has decreased over time

present$boys > present$girls

# Arbuthnots obersavtion holds up as well!
```


# 4
```{r}
present %>%
  mutate(Total = present$boys + present$girls) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total))

# The year with the highest toal population was 1961
```
